**Scenario Overview**

At its peak, TestOrg serves thousands of customers daily through its scalable cloud-based platform. One fateful afternoon, during the launch of a major new feature, TestOrg experiences an unexpected outage that brings critical services to a halt. This disruption not only halts user activity but also threatens the company's reputation and revenue streams, highlighting the urgent need for a robust incident management solution.

**Incident Narrative**

*Trigger Event:* The deployment of the new feature included a faulty configuration in the load balancer settings.

*Symptoms:* Users began reporting slow performance and intermittent access issues within minutes of the deployment. Monitoring tools showed a spike in error rates and latency across multiple services.

*Diagnostic Findings:* Initial diagnostics pinpointed abnormal traffic patterns and service failures in the load balancer module. Deeper analysis revealed that the misconfigured settings caused a backlog of requests, leading to cascading failures in downstream services.

*Root Cause:* A single incorrect parameter in the load balancer configuration file triggered a chain reaction, overwhelming the system and causing widespread service disruption.
