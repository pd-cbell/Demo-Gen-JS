**Scenario Overview:**
On a bustling Monday morning, Morgan Stanley experiences an unexpected outage in its high-frequency trading (HFT) platform just as global markets open. This disruption threatens millions in transactions, risking financial losses and damaging client trust. The situation demands an immediate, coordinated response to prevent a cascading failure across trading operations.
