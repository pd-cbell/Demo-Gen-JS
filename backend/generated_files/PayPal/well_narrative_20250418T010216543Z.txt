**1. Scenario Overview**

PayPal experiences a minor surge in API response latency for its transaction processing service. While the increase is within tolerable limits and does not impact the majority of users, it triggers an automated alert based on predefined thresholds. Utilizing PagerDuty's automation and PayPal's runbooks, the issue is detected and resolved without human intervention, ensuring seamless service continuity.

**2. Incident Narrative**

At 10:15 AM UTC, PayPal's monitoring system detects that the transaction processing API response times have exceeded the normal threshold by 20%. The alert is classified as a P4 (low-severity) incident since it does not significantly impact user transactions or overall system functionality. The automated monitoring tool sends an alert to PagerDuty, which references the associated runbook for handling such latency issues.

**3. Fully Automated Response**

Upon receiving the alert, PagerDuty's automation engine triggers the corresponding runbook designed for API latency issues. The runbook includes the following automated steps:

- **Step 1:** Initiate a lightweight diagnostic script to verify the extent of the latency.
- **Step 2:** Automatically restart the affected API service instance to clear potential temporary glitches.
- **Step 3:** Monitor the API response times post-restart to ensure they return to normal levels.
- **Step 4:** Log all actions taken and update the incident status in the monitoring dashboard.

These actions are executed without any manual intervention, leveraging PayPalâ€™s established automation infrastructure integrated with PagerDuty.

**4. Zero-Touch Resolution**

Within two minutes of the initial alert, the automated runbook completes all predefined steps:

- The diagnostic script confirms a transient spike in latency.
- The affected API service instance is restarted automatically.
- Subsequent monitoring shows that API response times have normalized.
- All actions and outcomes are logged for auditing purposes.

Since the automated processes successfully resolved the issue and restored normal API performance, no human operators were required to intervene, achieving a zero-touch resolution.

**Outage Summary:**

A transient API response latency spike was automatically detected and resolved within two minutes using PagerDuty's automation and PayPal's runbooks, ensuring uninterrupted service.
